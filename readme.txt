Given some points, this program plots the polynomial of minimal degree that passes through them.
The program reads the points from a file called "data.txt" and reads points that are formatted line by line as "x y".
The program calculates the polynomial using Lagrange Interpolation.  The Lagrange polynomials are calculated and added together to find the final polynomial.
The default "data.txt" file contains three points that result in the polynomial f(x) = x^2.
